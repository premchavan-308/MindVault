## 🎯 Project Objective

- To improve **logic building skills** using Python
- To understand core programming concepts such as:
  - Loops
  - Conditional statements
  - Functions
  - Input validation
- To integrate Python logic with **web technologies**
- To gain hands-on experience in **full-stack basics**

## 🎮 Project Overview

MindVault is a number-based game where players guess a hidden number within a defined range.  
The game tracks the **number of attempts** required to finish, which is used as the score.

The project demonstrates how backend logic written in Python can be connected with a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
